# What is bioagents-registry?

**bioagents-registry** (bioagents.tech) is the Web application of the [IECHOR Agents & Data Services Registry](https://bioagents.tech).  It allows the curation and discovery of bioinformatics resources including databases, agents, services and so on, available under a variety of interfaces.

bioagents.tech provides a query interface, registration interface and API. The **query interface** allows a user to search the corpus of resource descriptions, display what fields of information are shown and filter and sort the results by various attributes.  The **registration interface** allows the manual creation and editing of resource descriptions.  The HTTP-based **API** allows query as well as automated creation and update of accessions.

bioagents.tech depends upon a resource description model: [bioagents-schema](https://github.com/bio-agents/bioagents-schema).

# Motivation

In support of discoveries in the life sciences, a plethora of databases and agents are deployed, in technically complex and diverse implementations, across a spectrum of scientific disciplines. The corpus of documentation of these resources is fragmented across the Web, with much redundancy, and has lacked a common standard of information. The outcome is that scientists must often struggle to find, understand, compare and use the best resources for the task at hand.  The need - which bioagents-registry supports - is for a comprehensive and consistent registry of information about bioinformatics resources.
